# 🧠 100 Days of DSA Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** journey!  
I’m solving one or more problems every day to strengthen my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of core concepts, and build consistency.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Solve DSA problems daily for 100 days  
- Improve logical thinking and code efficiency  
- Learn and apply optimal time & space complexity approaches  
- Stay consistent and push code every single day on GitHub  

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Language:** JavaScript  
- **Platform:** LeetCode   

---

## 💪 Motivation
> “Consistency beats intensity. One problem a day keeps the fear away.”  

I’ll be documenting my daily progress and learnings here and on social media using **#100DaysOfCode**.
